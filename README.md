# Cracking the Coding Interview in Ruby
Ruby solutions to the questions and exercises found in Cracking the Coding
Interview, 6th Edition.

## Usage

1. Install the required gems with `bundle install`.
2. Start guard. `bundle exec guard`

## What's the goal of this repository?
This is a personal repo that I (@sayhiben) am practicing from, as it has been
many years since I've taken an Algorithms or Data Structures course. The answers
found in this repo are my own work. When stuck, I've referenced the solutions in
the book to better comprehend how to implement a solution in ruby. Many of my solutions are not optimal solutions.

## I have a suggestion for this repository
If you find errors in this repository, please submit an issue or pull request.
